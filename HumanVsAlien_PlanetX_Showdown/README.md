# HumanVsAlien_PlanetX_Showdown.rblx (Source Layout)

This repository provides a full place **source hierarchy** because binary `.rblx/.rbxl` output is not generated in this environment.

## Do you need to add a lobby?
No extra files are required now: a playable lobby + Earth base + PlanetX base are auto-generated by `MapBuilderService` when the server starts.

## Folder mapping to Roblox services
- `ServerScriptService/*` -> Server game systems (authoritative logic)
- `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/*` -> Shared config and definition modules
- `ReplicatedStorage/Remotes` -> Remote events (auto-created by `RemotesService`)
- `StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/*` -> HUD and animation controllers
- `StarterGui/RetrowaveHUD/*` -> Retrowave UI bootstrap
- `Workspace/MapPlaceholders/*` -> Optional manual map notes if you want custom geometry

## Implemented systems
- Round loop and endings (Alien Vaporization, Human Military, Secret Peace)
- Team and role framework with passive/active/cooldowns and loadouts
- Death Ray objective with EMP disable and instant activation GamePass validation
- Persistent economy (coins, wins, times leader, peace unlock)
- Shop purchases validated on server
- Leadership framework for President/Overmind + pass checks
- Admin command pipeline with allow-list UserIds and rate limiting
- Security layer for rate-limits and trust boundaries
- Runtime map generation for lobby, spawns, fuel nodes, objective structures
- Nexus Dynamics integration bridge (`NexusDynamicsService`) with placeholder asset ID

## Nexus Dynamics (dev equip)
This repo now includes a bridge service. To fully enable the package:
1. Insert the official Nexus Dynamics model/package into `ReplicatedStorage`.
2. Rename it to `NexusDynamics`.
3. Set `Config.External.NexusDynamicsAssetId`.
4. If the package exports APIs, bind them inside `NexusDynamicsService`.

## Assembly steps in Roblox Studio
1. Create a new place named `HumanVsAlien_PlanetX_Showdown`.
2. Recreate folder/file structure in corresponding Roblox services.
3. Paste script contents from this source layout.
4. Replace all placeholder IDs in `Config.lua`.
5. Configure DataStore name/scope and admin UserIds.
6. Press Play to auto-build map and start the round flow.

## Balance tuning
See `ReplicatedStorage/Modules/Config.lua` for central balance controls.
Humans are slightly stronger through reward multiplier and research scaling.
